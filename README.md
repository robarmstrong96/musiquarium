<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Musiquarium is a web application music manager designed to manage a collection of music with customizability suited for a variety of different user preferences. Musiquarium natively offers a wider-range of options for characterising the music inside the library compared to other media managers, allowing for user's to customize certain aspects to how Musiquarium  collects, stores, and characterizes their music.

This web application will be capable of what most music library managers can do, just with some added configurability. While this application is intended for anyone, the added configurability is meant for those wanting to fine-tune certain aspects to their library management experience (metadata source, choice of media recognization, etc...) when wanted while still keeping the simplicity for when they might not. Also, this application will be specifically designed for a linux-server environment for user's hoping to manage server stored music through a web-gui (but may be usable in a normal desktop setup). Because of this, this application is targeted mainly for those possessing a media server, with some basic server-environment knowledge (unix permissions, linux command line commands, secure shell, networking, etc...) you will be able to:
* Create a library through stored music
* Choose more than one music recognition method
* Choose where music information/metadata is pulled from
* Configure the automated library creation process
* Customize library through a web GUI, viewing and making changes where needed

### Built With
